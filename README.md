# Data Analysis scripts

# To do:

## Relative paths in all scripts
## Pressure analysis
  - Separation point from pressure data
  - Separation point from pressure data
  - Comparison
    - Figure some numerical metric to compare both points (eg: difference in position in degrees wrt sphere center)
## Subtraction of potential flow v.f. to ensemble averaged v.f.
  - Maximum difference
    - Positive
    - Negative
  - Standard deviation
## Subtraction of CFD v.f. to ensemble averaged v.f.
  - Maximum difference
    - Positive
    - Negative
  - Standard deviation
